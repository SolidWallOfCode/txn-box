Transaction Box
***************

Transaction Box, or "txn_box", is an Apache Traffic Server plugin to manipulate
:term:`transaction`\s. The functionality is based on requests I have received over the years from
users and admnistrators for |TS|. The primary points of interest are

*  YAML based configuration.
*  Interaction between global and remap hooks.
*  Consistent access
